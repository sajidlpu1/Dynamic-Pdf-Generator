I made a Dynamic Invoice Generator Single Page Application that creates invoices dynamically. This helps to automate billings, invoices, etc.
I have used ReactJS and Node.js to develop this Application.
GitHub: https://lnkd.in/d-MzC6b
Packages used:
Client-Side:
Axios: To make server requests
file-saver: Save huge files to the files system

Server Side:
express: Framework made upon node.js that helps in routing
body-parser: Parse incoming request bodies in a middleware
cors: package for providing a Connect/Express middleware that can be used to enable CORS with various options
html-pdf: HTML to PDF converter
